# What is panel-bot
Panel bot is a way to control your discord bot with a panel, it is more or less an example on how you would do this
which is why it only includes sending messages
# Why cant I run the bot?
You need to make a var.json which should look something like this:
```json
{
 "token":"$TOKENGOESHERE"
}
```
# Who made this?
Look at the repo dingus, it was me (AFancyDog)
